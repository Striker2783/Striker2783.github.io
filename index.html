          Hello, I am Striker2783. I am currently a student at [Insert]
          University studying to get a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
          (BSCS). I have been interested in Computer Science for a while.

        <h1>Knowledge</h1>
        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Java: I learned this through my university's Computer Science I and
            II courses. I like Java because it is a nice high level language
            that also teaches Object Oriented Design. If I was given a choice to
            what language to use for a coding competition, I would probably
            choose Java due to its high level nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rust: I learned this through reading through the
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book</a> and
            programming algorithms to solve problems. I like Rust due to its mix
            of high level and low level features. It also taught me how to be
            safe when working with low-level languages like C/C++. It has a lot
            of positive features that I love like macros, traits, and default
            testing. Of course, it also sometimes has a lot of boilerplate when
            it comes to lifetimes and generics. If I was to make an algorithm
            for production use, I would use Rust due to its speed and safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            Javascript/Typescript: I also learned this through my own. I play
            many HTML games and I initially learned some Javascript by looking
            through the game's code to see how the game worked (and maybe
            exploit it a bit). I started really learning the languages when I
            started to learn about web development. I do like the dynamic nature
            of Javascript and being able to easily program stuff in, but it is a
            pain to debug. That's why I like Typescript more, which allows for
            better types, making it easier for me to read code and program stuff
            in. Typescript can be a pain with a bunch of types. I mainly would
            use this if I was doing a full stack application with the same
            language.

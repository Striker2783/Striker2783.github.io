        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Owen Kemp. I am currently a student at Wright State
          University. My majors are a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
          (BSCS) and a Bachelor's of Science in Physics. I am a senior in
          Computer Science and a Junior in Physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          My motivation to do Computer Science is that I love learning about how
          to build and optimize software. I first started making simple games in
          Roblox around 2018 with a primary focus on trying to build
          maintainable software. I enjoyed programming a ton and worked on
          random side projects between schools. Because of this, I majored in
          Computer Science when I first went to University.
        </p>
        <p>
          My motivation to do physics is that I also love to understand how the
          physical world interacts. I first got started into physics when I took
          physics at Wright State in Fall 2023. I found physics to be very
          interesting and decided to major in it 2 years later after taking more
          advanced physics courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal with both majors is to understand how to build and optimize
          software designed for physical products. An example includes creating
          software for robotics.
        </p>

          My Personal Github is
          <a href="https://github.com/Striker2783/">Striker2783</a> and my
          Github for school is
          <a href="https://github.com/Porogaramu">Porogaramu</a>. I do care a
          bit about my privacy, so almost all of my accounts are not my actual
          name, but they are somewhat consistent in naming.

        <h1>Knowledge</h1>

        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Python</b>: I learned this language through many courses at my
            university. I like Python because it is really simple to use, and
            the huge number of libraries that support it. I have mainly used it
            for data stuff with libraries like NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, SymPy,
            Matplotlib, SciPy, CPMPy, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Java</b>: I learned this through my university's Computer Science
            I and II courses. I like Java because it is a nice high level
            language that also teaches Object Oriented Design. If I was given a
            choice to what language to use for a coding competition, I would
            probably choose Java due to its high level nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rust</b>: I learned this through reading through the
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book</a> and
            programming algorithms to solve problems. I like Rust due to its mix
            of high level and low level features. It also taught me how to be
            safe when working with low-level languages like C/C++. It has a lot
            of positive features that I love like macros, traits, and default
            testing. Of course, it also sometimes has a lot of boilerplate when
            it comes to lifetimes and generics. If I was to make an algorithm
            for production use, I would use Rust due to its speed and safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Javascript/Typescript</b>: I also learned this through my own. I
            play many HTML games and I initially learned some Javascript by
            looking through the game's code to see how the game worked (and
            maybe exploit it a bit). I started really learning the languages
            when I started to learn about web development. I do like the dynamic
            nature of Javascript and being able to easily program stuff in, but
            it is a pain to debug. That's why I like Typescript more, which
            allows for better types, making it easier for me to read code and
            program stuff in. Typescript can be a pain with a bunch of types. I
            mainly would use this if I was doing a full stack application with
            the same language.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Framesworks Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Spring Boot</b>: this ia mainly a backend framework developed for
            Java to create API endpoints. I have used this framework in two of
            my projects:
            <a href="/projects/CEG4110"> Restaurant Ordering System </a>
            and <a href="/projects/CS4900/">Car Maintenance Tracker</a>. I have
            also used JUnit (Unit/Integration Testing), Java Persistence (JPA),
            and Mapstruct.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>NextJS</b>: this is a full stack framework written in Javascript
            and developed by Vercel. I used this framework when developing a
            website for a Youtube channel that I helped manage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ExpressJS</b>: this is a backend library written in Javascript.
            This is a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework for building
            APIs and server-side applications. I used this in the
            <a href="https://github.com/andrii-malakhovtsev/accountmap"
              >Account Map</a
            >
            Project.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Frontends</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>React</b>: a reactive frontend framework for interactive
            websites. I have used this frontend a bit in building websites (not
            listed in this portfolio). I know most of the basic features of
            React and how to build React websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Java Swing</b>: I learned this in my Computer Science classes and
            used it in the
            <a href="/projects/CEG4110/">Restaurant Ordering System</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Visual Studio Code</b>: This is the main code editor I use when
            programming any language. It has vast numbers of extensions that I
            use to improve my coding experience. It also contains many features
            I love like multiple cursors, quick open, and quick find. A few
            things that I dislike is that it can be slow with large projects and
            a lack of features IDEs have.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Git</b>: This is the version control system I use for any of my
            projects. I mainly use Git on the command line and in VSCode where
            it's a bit more convenient. I have done plenty of squashing of
            commits using Git.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Github</b>: This is the main site where I push my repositories. I
            have used many features of Github, such as Issues and Pull Requests,
            creating workflows, and configuring a repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Linux Commands</b>: I know plenty of Linux commands to navigate
            through a Linux system. I use Ubuntu LTS on my main computer.

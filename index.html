        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Striker2783. I am currently a student at [Insert]
          University studying to get a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science
          (BSCS). I have been interested in Computer Science for a while.

        <h1>Knowledge</h1>
        
        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Java: I learned this through my university's Computer Science I and
            II courses. I like Java because it is a nice high level language
            that also teaches Object Oriented Design. If I was given a choice to
            what language to use for a coding competition, I would probably
            choose Java due to its high level nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rust: I learned this through reading through the
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book</a> and
            programming algorithms to solve problems. I like Rust due to its mix
            of high level and low level features. It also taught me how to be
            safe when working with low-level languages like C/C++. It has a lot
            of positive features that I love like macros, traits, and default
            testing. Of course, it also sometimes has a lot of boilerplate when
            it comes to lifetimes and generics. If I was to make an algorithm
            for production use, I would use Rust due to its speed and safety.
          </li>
          <li>
            Javascript/Typescript: I also learned this through my own. I play
            many HTML games and I initially learned some Javascript by looking
            through the game's code to see how the game worked (and maybe
            exploit it a bit). I started really learning the languages when I
            started to learn about web development. I do like the dynamic nature
            of Javascript and being able to easily program stuff in, but it is a
            pain to debug. That's why I like Typescript more, which allows for
            better types, making it easier for me to read code and program stuff
            in. Typescript can be a pain with a bunch of types. I mainly would
            use this if I was doing a full stack application with the same
            language.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Visual Studio Code: This is the main code editor I use when
            programming any language. It has vast numbers of extensions that I
            can use to improve my coding experience. It also contains many
            features I love like multiple cursors, quick open, and quick find. A
            few things that I dislike is that it can be slow with large projects
            and a lack of features IDEs have.
          </li>
          <li>
            Git: This is the version control system I use for any of my
            projects. I mainly use Git on the command line and in VSCode where
            it's a bit more convenient. I have done plenty of squashing of
            commits using Git.
          </li>
          <li>
            Github: This is the main site where I push my repositories. I have
            used many features of Github, such as Issues and Pull Requests,
            creating workflows, and configuring a repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Linux Commands: I know plenty of Linux commands to navigate through
            a Linux system. The main Operating System I use is Ubuntu on my main
            computer.

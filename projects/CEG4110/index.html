                <h1>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was a project for an Introduction to Software Engineering Course. I was in a team of four
                        to work on this project. We planned the project using a hybrid usage of both Waterfall and Agile
                        Methodology of Software Engineering that will be detailed <a href="#Methodology">below</a>. The
                        goal was to understand the software engineering process and be able to apply it to create some
                        software. We decided to make some software to allow restaurants to more easily handle customer
                        orders to improve efficiency. In order to do so, we used Java in both the Server and User
                        Interface. The server used <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Java Spring Boot</a>
                        while the User Interface used <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">Java
                            Swing</a>. Additionally, we used a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database along
                        with an Object-relational mapping <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa">JPA</a>.

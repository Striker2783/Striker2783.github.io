        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          I made this bot to help me moderate our Discord server that currently
          has over 10,000 members in it. I also wanted to reduce the number of
          bots in our server to reduce the security vulnerabilities that the
          bots could pose if they get malicious. I have this bot running on my
          Raspberry PI 3 at home. I will keep add more features to it when it is
          useful for me to.

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Filtering</b>: filters user messages based on what they sent.
            This may also warn the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Warning System</b>: made a warning system that keeps count of the
            warnings a user has and gives punishment based on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Track Number of Members</b>: automatically updates channels'
            names based on how many members are in the server. I made this
            feature to replace the Server Stats Discord Bot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Welcomes and Goodbyes Users</b>: automatically sends a short
            message whenever someone leaves or joins the server. This features
            was used to replace the Welcomer bot. It also automatically adds a
            Member role whenever someone joins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Commands</b>: allows admins to run commands to warn users, delete
            messages, and other things. This is mainly for convenience for me.
          </li>
